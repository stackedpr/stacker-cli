# TODO

- `list`: lists main and items
- dx options
  - running `next` without `start` - give a hint and option to run `start`
  - replace `start`/`next` with "new" with meaning inference
  - `new` will always create a new branch based on the branch at the top of the stack
- `up`/`down` command options - rebases up or merges
  - all branches
  - just adjacent
- convert PR title into template and not hard coded
